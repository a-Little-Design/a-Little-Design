Notice!\nThis is my first way to deployed the project with hugo-theme-itheme. But I deployed a new blog with hugo-theme-Blowfish now. Blowfish is more difficult than iTheme. Maybe this old tutorial is not good enough to set up the HUGO blog with Blowfish. You can read the official tutorial to learn the Blowfish installation way. Welcome to my blog. # This is a blog with Hugo and hugo-theme-itheme which deployed on Github Pages. If you like this project, please give the project a star！\nHow to Set Up HUGO Blog on Windows. # I find some ways to create a simple blog with Github Pages. You can search the tutorial from Internet easily. But I can\u0026rsquo;t set up the HUGO Blog on Windows. The Browser always give the message that Page Not Found. After I try some ways and search much information, I get some experience on Windows OS. I finally fix the problem. Here are the following steps. # First # Visit the tutorial on official website . https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/ Download HUGO on Github. Unzip the files to the location. Such as C:\\Program Files\\hugo Add the Hugo file path to Windows system PATH environment. # Second # Open the cmd.exe Input command hugo version, it will get the correct information if you install Hugo successfully. So you can input the hugo command on CMD.exe easily. Create a file used for your Hugo project. Such as C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ . Then input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ cmd.exe , Input command hugo new site blog blog, it\u0026rsquo;s the name of your project name, you can input anything you want. Now you can find the new file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog The new files of the Hugo will be created in this location.Such as archetypes, layouts, static, themes, config.toml. hugo version cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ hugo new site blog # Third # cmd.exe ,You must cd the location in blog first. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe , Input command hugo new post/first.md Input and text something in the file. Such as Hello World! You can find the file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\post\\first.md cmd.exe , Input command hugo new about.md Input and text something in the file. Such as Hello World! You can find the file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\about.md You can find some tutorial to change the file config.toml ,C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\config.toml cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog hugo new post/first.md hugo new about.md # Fourth # cmd.exe ,You must cd the location in blog first. Input command cd blog or cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command cd themes , The correct location is C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes , Create it if you can\u0026rsquo;t find it in location. cmd.exe ,Input command git clone https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme.git git command is the tool of Git.

You can find the location C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes\\hugo-theme-itheme Change the file parameter of config.toml , C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\config.toml, add the theme = 'hugo-theme-itheme' The parameter of config.toml. You can find this GitHub to learn the Site Configuration with config.toml. defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; # only support (en) and (zh-hans) [params] defaultCover = \u0026#39;https://example.com/cover.jpg\u0026#39; email = \u0026#39;floyd.li@outlook.com\u0026#39; # the email address display in the footer [[params.socialMedia]] name = \u0026#39;Github\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://github.com/floyd-li\u0026#39; [[params.socialMedia]] name = \u0026#39;Twitter\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://twitter.com/some-one\u0026#39; [[params.blogroll]] name = \u0026#39;Apple\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://Apple.com/\u0026#39; [[params.blogroll]] name = \u0026#39;Google\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://Google.com/\u0026#39; Other Command. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes git clone https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme.git # Fifth # cmd.exe ,Input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command hugo server -D Now something display on cmd.exe, such as localhost:1313. Copy localhost:1313 to your Browser such as Chrome. You can open the offline website on the browser if you succeed. Your Hugo Blog Project work fine on your Windows.

After I input http://localhost:1313/ to Bowser what I installed. They always gave me a message that Page Not Found. I finally get a useful page to fix it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46216333/why-my-single-page-in-hugo-returns-a-404-http-error Do the same thing such as Fifth way. cmd.exe ,Input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command hugo server -D -t hugo-theme-itheme You can add the input command -t hugo-theme-itheme after hugo server -D. hugo-theme-itheme can replace the name of other theme which you has installed.
