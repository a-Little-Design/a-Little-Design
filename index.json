注意事项。\n本文最初使用的是 hugo-theme-itheme 主题。 现在本站转用新的Hugo主题 hugo-theme-Blowfish 。 Blowfish 主题，相比 iTheme 主题更复杂和精致。 本文属于入门的经验总结，并非详尽的技术教程。 HUGO Blowfish 主题需要一定使用经验，初级用户建议先学习使用 iTheme 主题。 建议直接参考 Blowfish 安装教程。 初始教程请参考 Hugo - 一个适用于Github Pages的静态博客框架 初级篇 欢迎来到小站 本站使用 Hugo 和 hugo-theme-itheme 主题，并部署在GitHub Pages上面。\n主题的开源仓库 hugo-theme-itheme \u0026amp; https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme\n新建GitHub仓库，托管网站代码和静态网页文件。 前言：\n之前完成了Windows本地博客的创建。 现在将博客项目的“源码”托管到GitHub仓库上。 一、 First 新建 GitHub仓库A，托管博客“源码”。 # 创建新的仓库，名字随意，例如 Hugo-Blog-Code Create a new repository # “源码”仓库可以设置为“非公开” Private # 点击底部按钮创建 Create repository # 将本地“blog”里面的所有文件，同步到 GitHub 的 Hugo-Blog-Code仓库上。本地路径参考 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\ # 本地“blog”的所有文件，等于是构建整个博客的“源码”。 二、 Second 新建 GitHub仓库B，用于静态网页文件的存放。 # 创建新的仓库，仓库名字格式： xxx.github.io , xxx 代表用户 userid 名称。（这样做可以直接访问 xxx.github.io 为 Pages 主页，不需加上次级路径。例如，静态网页文件若放在 Hugo-New 仓库，那么 Pages主页 就被定向到 xxx.github.io/hugo-new 页面。） Create a new repository # 本仓库必须设置为“公开” Public # 点击最底的创建 Create repository # 新建分支，例如 gh-pages ,（为了保持 main 主分支的“干净整洁”。）切记，以后不要点击“同步分支”等相关操作。 进入 View all branches ，点击 New branch 即可创建。 三、 Third 创建个人token #进入开发者设置。 点击头像，进入Settings。找到左下角最底的 Developer settings # 进入 Personal access tokens 点击 Personal access tokens里面的 Tokens(classic)选项。 # 生成 tokens 点击 Generate new token，选择 Generate new token(classic)。会提示输入Github密码。 # 填写相关 tokens 参数 Note处随便填名字。Expiration处可以修改token过期的时间。默认30Day，建议延长时间。 # 选择 Select scopes 勾选下方的 repo 和 workflow 即可。 # 生成 tokens Generate token 按钮生成 # 复制 token 的字符信息到本地（切记保存好。这个页面只会显示一次字符。再次刷新只会显示填写的 Note名字。）那串token字符在后面一定要用到。 ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # token 若过期或遗失，请再次重新生成。 四、 Fourth 给仓库分配 token。(分配给执行自动化Actions任务的仓库。) # 进入仓库A，就是“源码”托管的仓库。例如 Hugo-Blog-Code 进入仓库设置Settings，找到 Secrets and variables，找到 Actions。 # 右上角新建Actions secret New repository secret # 填写 Actions secrets / New secret信息 Name需要填写 personal_token ，Sercret必须填写刚才生成的tokens字符ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # 确认 Add secret # 理论上，token 若过期，必须要再次重复步骤三、步骤四。 五、 Fifth 设定Actions的自动化配置。 这里使用仓库A，就是“源码”托管的私有仓库。例如 Hugo-Blog-Code # 创建 hugo.yml文件。 保存在此仓库路径下 /.github/workflows/hugo.yml （可以本地新建相应文件夹目录，然后上传到GitHub。） # hugo.yml（最简方法，本地直接创建一个.txt文件，修改为 hugo.yml 即可。注意不要保留.txt后缀。） hugo.yml hugo.yml 的具体参数如下。 name: GitHub Pages on: push: branches: - main # Set a branch to deploy 博客“源码”存放的分支 pull_request: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest concurrency: group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.111.3\u0026#39; # 版本要对应本地安装的Hugo版本。具体 hugo version 查看。以及是否启用 hugo extend extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 if: ${{ github.ref == \u0026#39;refs/heads/main\u0026#39; }} with: personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} external_repository: xxx/xxx.github.io # 前面为 userid 名，后面为 userid.github.io publish_branch: gh-pages # Pages 仓库文件存放的分支，默认为 main publish_dir: ./public commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }} 解释 publish_branch: gh-pages # Pages 文件存放的分支，默认为 main 。为了方便管理仓库，自建了 gh-pages 分支。不熟悉的话直接填 main 。 gh-pages 或者 main ，本地博客仓库的 public 里所包含的文件的存放位置。 如果不使用 Actions自动化部署博客。可以直接跳过前面仓库A、新建token、新建hugo.yml等内容。（只需新建 xxx.github.io 仓库 ） 然后上传本地 public 里面的所有文件到GitHub，xxx.github.io 仓库的根目录上。 然后在该仓库的 GitHub Pages设置中，指定到 /gh-pages 或者 /main 目录即可。 六、 Sixth 实现部署到GitHub Pages\n设置 GitHub Pages参数。 这里要设置的是仓库B，xxx.github.io 仓库。 # 进入 仓库B 的Settings Settings，左边找到 Pages 选项 # 设置 Pages 参数 Source 选择 Deploy from a branch # 设置 Pages 参数 Branch 选择 gh-pages 或者 main #（对应 hugo.yml 所填路径） # 设置 Pages 参数 Branch 选择 /(root) # 设置Custom domain 域名和DNS解释等方法，请搜寻网上的相关教程。（这步可以先忽略，非必须。Pages网站上线以后，可自行添加。） 启动 Actions自动化。 前提：\n仓库A，Hugo-Blog-Code 的 hugo.yml 文件参数正确。（注意token有效期，若过期，请及时更新token） 仓库B，xxx.github.io 的 Pages 参数完成设置。 # 本地博客新增和编写文章，Git 上传，推送 commit 到“源码”仓库A。 Actions根据hugo.yml触发deploy到仓库B，完成线上博客更新。 # “源码”仓库A，线上修改或增加文章，确定 commit 完成。 Actions根据hugo.yml触发deploy到仓库B，完成线上博客更新。 # 总之，“源码”仓库A 有任何成功的 commit ，都会触发 Actions的执行。（ 免费版 GitHub好像配额500 MB存储，2000分钟数（每月），具体[查询官网](https://docs.github.com/zh/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)。）一般的博客应该足够使用。 # 有关 Markdown 语法和内嵌图片等操作，请参考其官方教程。 总结 感谢浏览这篇文章，虽然算不上技术教程，希望这些经验能给予你帮助。 这个流程已经是最精简的了，希望你能够看懂。 Screenshot Copyright: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)✨\n","date":"22 March 2022","permalink":"/posts/github-pages-hugo2-zh-hans/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hugo - 简单，高效地搭建博客。 Notice!","title":"Hugo - Github Pages博客的自动化部署 进阶篇"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2022","permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tech"},{"content":" Simple, just amazing.

https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme\n更新：在文章最后，写了一个简化版的配置流程。 在 Windows 创建本地的 HUGO 博客。 前言：\nHugo是一款博客生成器，其生成的静态网页能够在Github Pages等平台上轻松部署。 优点：Hugo支持Markdown编写文章。Hugo拥有丰富的主题，能够简单定制和个性化。Hugo不需要复杂的组件支持，能够简单高效地生成和升级网站内容。 思路：Windows部署Hugo本地博客（前期的本地调试和网站制作）。然后上传项目到GitHub，利用GitHub的Actions功能，自动将博客网站部署到GitHub Pages。 GitHub与Hugo的教程有多。相对地，GitLab的教程就比较少，最主要是GitLab平台的部署方法有点复杂，其实GitLab部署的原理更简单。（以后有时间再探讨其它平台的部署经验。） 最初参照网上的 Windows教程，很快就能生成本地网站，但是一直无法正常打开，浏览器一直显示Page Not Found信息，不是网络问题导致的那种错误信息，而是Hugo生成的错误信息。 几乎找遍中文教程，都没有提及这个问题。折腾很长时间才能够解决。因此，才有了这篇经验总结。 文章写得有点繁琐，请见谅。文章内容是部署的思路和解释，具体流程直接使用“精简版”的命令行即可。（更新，最底有“简化版”配置流程。） 一、 First Hugo官网 https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/ 下载 HUGO 链接 Github 解压文件到，例如 C:\\Program Files\\hugo Windows 系统变量里添加 PATH 变量，直接找到该路径。 1.精简版：下载Hugo，配置环境变量。\n二、 Second 以下的命令直接使用 cmd.exe 。 如果上一步成功设置“系统变量”,输入 hugo version, 显示Hugo版本信息。 找一个合适位置创建Hugo文件夹，例如 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ 。输入命令 cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\。如果放在D盘，cmd里先直接输入d:，然后再cd D:\\Hugo\\进入路径。 输入命令，创建一个Hugo新博客 hugo new site blog。这个blog名字随便改。 Hugo新建的博客文件存放在此路径 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog。blog文件夹内通常包含一些文件，例如 archetypes, layouts, static, themes, config.toml。 2.精简版：分别输入以下三行命令。\nhugo version cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ hugo new site blog 三、 Third 进入项目。命令 cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog 新建post文件夹和文章一文档。命令 hugo new post/first.md 编辑文档first.md，随便输入 Hello World!等任意内容。 文件的路径为 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\post\\first.md 新建关于页面文件。命令 hugo new about.md 编辑文本about.md，随便输入 Hello World!等任意内容。文件的路径为 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\about.md 具体如何修改博客内容和写博文，请查看Hugo相关教程。 注意：这一步所创建的.md文件，都存放于“blog”之下的content文件夹中。C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content 3.精简版：分别输入以下三行命令。\ncd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog hugo new post/first.md hugo new about.md 四、 Fourth 此处记得在cmd进入路径 。 命令 cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes 。如果blog里面没有 themes 文件夹，手动新建一个。 在themes 路径中，输入命令 git clone https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme.git。使用Git命令要先安装软件 https://git-scm.com/ 如果能正常 git clone 下载到主题 hugo-theme-itheme。那么路径应该是 C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes\\hugo-theme-itheme 修改项目的 config.toml文件, , 添加参数 theme = 'hugo-theme-itheme'。参考路径为C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\config.toml 文件 config.toml的参数定义， 请参考 GitHub 主题的说明 config.toml参数，仅供参考。\ndefaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;

Notice!\nThis is my first way to deployed the project with hugo-theme-itheme. But I deployed a new blog with hugo-theme-Blowfish now. Blowfish is more difficult than iTheme. Maybe this old tutorial is not good enough to set up the HUGO blog with Blowfish. You can read the official tutorial to learn the Blowfish installation way. Welcome to my blog. This is a blog with Hugo and hugo-theme-itheme which deployed on Github Pages. **Hugo is a fantasy framework for building websites. If you like this project, please give the repository a star！\nHow to Set Up HUGO Blog on Windows. I find some ways to create a simple blog with Github Pages. You can search the tutorial from Internet easily. But I can\u0026rsquo;t set up the HUGO Blog on Windows. The Browser always give the message that Page Not Found. After I try some ways and search much information, I get some experience on Windows OS. I finally fix the problem. Here are the following steps. 1. First Visit the tutorial on official website . https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/ Download HUGO on Github. Unzip the files to the location. Such as C:\\Program Files\\hugo Add the Hugo file path to Windows system PATH environment. # Install Hugo. # Set up the Windows PATH environment. 2. Second Open the cmd.exe Input command hugo version, it will get the correct information if you install Hugo successfully. So you can input the hugo command on CMD.exe easily. Create a file used for your Hugo project. Such as C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ . Then input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ cmd.exe , Input command hugo new site blog blog, it\u0026rsquo;s the name of your project name, you can input anything you want. Now you can find the new file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog The new files of the Hugo will be created in this location.Such as archetypes, layouts, static, themes, config.toml. # Check the Hugo. hugo version # Input location. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\ # Create a new Hugo Blog. hugo new site blog 3. Third cmd.exe ,You must cd the location in blog first. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe , Input command hugo new post/first.md Input and text something in the file. Such as Hello World! You can find the file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\post\\first.md cmd.exe , Input command hugo new about.md Input and text something in the file. Such as Hello World! You can find the file in C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\content\\about.md You can find some tutorial to change the file config.toml ,C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\config.toml # Input location. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog # Create a post folder and a new article. hugo new post/first.md # Create new about page. hugo new about.md 4. Fourth cmd.exe ,You must cd the location in blog first. Input command cd blog or cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command cd themes , The correct location is C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes , Create it if you can\u0026rsquo;t find it in location. cmd.exe ,Input command git clone https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme.git git command is the tool of Git. You must install it first. https://git-scm.com/ Now you download the Hugo theme - hugo-theme-itheme. You can find the location C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes\\hugo-theme-itheme Change the file parameter of config.toml , C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\config.toml, add the theme = 'hugo-theme-itheme' The parameter of config.toml. You can find this GitHub to learn the Site Configuration with config.toml. defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; # only support (en) and (zh-hans) [params] defaultCover = \u0026#39;https://example.com/cover.jpg\u0026#39; email = \u0026#39;xxx@outlook.com\u0026#39; # the email address display in the footer [[params.socialMedia]] name = \u0026#39;Github\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://github.com/floyd-li\u0026#39; [[params.socialMedia]] name = \u0026#39;Twitter\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://twitter.com/some-one\u0026#39; [[params.blogroll]] name = \u0026#39;Apple\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://Apple.com/\u0026#39; [[params.blogroll]] name = \u0026#39;Google\u0026#39; url = \u0026#39;https://Google.com/\u0026#39; Other Command. # Input location. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog\\themes # Clone the theme. git clone https://github.com/floyd-li/hugo-theme-itheme.git # Edit the config.toml 5. Fifth cmd.exe ,Input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command hugo server -D Now something display on cmd.exe, such as localhost:1313. Copy localhost:1313 to your Browser such as Chrome. You can open the offline website on the browser if you succeed. Your Hugo Blog Project work fine on your Windows. If you succeed to set up Hugo Blog, you just need to do step Fifth next time. # Input location. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog # Start Hugo on Windows. hugo server -D # Open Hugo blog site in browser. # http://localhost:1313 6. Sixth But I can\u0026rsquo;t do it well on my Windows. After I input http://localhost:1313/ to Bowser what I installed. They always gave me a message that Page Not Found. I finally get a useful page to fix it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46216333/why-my-single-page-in-hugo-returns-a-404-http-error Do the same thing such as Fifth way. cmd.exe ,Input command cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog cmd.exe ,Input command hugo server -D -t hugo-theme-itheme You can add the input command -t hugo-theme-itheme after hugo server -D. hugo-theme-itheme can replace the name of other theme which you has installed. Now something display on cmd.exe . It also has localhost:1313. Copy localhost:1313 to your Browser such as Chrome. I finally get the Hugo website correctly. No error message anymore. I hope that the experience is useful for you. # Input location. cd C:\\Downloads\\Hugo\\blog # Run Hugo on Windows. hugo server -D -t hugo-theme-itheme # Open Hugo blog site in browser. # http://localhost:1313 Summary You can write article offline easily on your Windows. Then you can upload the Hugo Blog to Github Pages easily. Please search the method on the Internet by yourself. Key words: github pages hugo. I am sorry that the steps are a bit complicated. Maybe I will write a new tutorial next time.
